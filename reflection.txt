What did you learn about KnockoutJS?
learned about adding lists and modify my child list, how can I change the lyrics in real time sorting lists, and add virtually everything we saw on this projects
What is MVVC? Why is it usefull?

is a design pattern for building user interfaces
model: to read and write this stored model data
 A view model: a pure-code representation of the data and operations on a UI
A view: a visible, interactive UI representing the state of the view model

What does the data-bind attribute do?
to link the data with the user interface.

What does the following code do? ko.applyBindings(viewModel);?
I understood why I next data-bind is used, serves to activate the knockout
